\subsection{Definition Export}

Here, we introduce the term \emph{noipper}.
A noipper is the main technical component of a noipping machine. Its purpose is to nullify the interference that is caused by exceedingly high neipping values in the system.

\subsection{Dataset Export}

Of course, there is a multitude of available noippers from different brands.
We compiled an exhaustive dataset that lists all available noippers and their features to allow for a fair comparison. The dataset is called noipperbase and is available at https://example.org/datasets/noipperbase.

\subsection{Experimental Result Export}

To ensure safe operation, the noipper has to nullify the interference as fast as possible.
We tested a readily available noipper in a typical neipping system and monitored the time it takes to nullify the interference when exceedingly high neipping values are encountered. On average, the process took 0.123 seconds based on 100000000 runs.
